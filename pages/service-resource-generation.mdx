# Service Resource Generation

1. The **`scaffold create:service-resource`** command will generate the interface and the service that implements it in the **`domain layer [use-cases]`**,
   this task has **`--name`** as parameter and **`--resource`** this is required. The name must be in lower case, as it is in the model.

   Example: **`--name=user --resource`**

```shell
   scaffold create:service --name=user --resource
```
