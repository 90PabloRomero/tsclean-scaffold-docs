# Service Generation

1. The **`scaffold create:service`** command will generate the interface and the service that implements it in the **`domain layer [use-cases]`**, this task has **`--name`** as parameter and this is required. The name must be hyphenated if it is a compound name.

   Example: **`--name=user, --name=user-detail, --name=post-comments-user.`**

```shell
   scaffold create:service --name=user
```
