# Controller Generation

1. The **`scaffold create:controller`** command will generate a controller in the **`infrastructure layer`**,
   this task has **`--name`** as parameter and this is required. The name must have a hyphen in case it is a compound name.

   Example: **`--name=user, --name=user-detail, --name=post-comments-user.`**

```shell
   scaffold create:controller --name=user-detail
```
