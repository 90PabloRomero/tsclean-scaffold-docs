Clean Architecture Scaffold is a powerful CLI tool that helps you create the structure of a Node.js and TypeScript project based on clean architecture principles. It provides a solid foundation for building RESTful APIs by integrating an Express application as a Node.js framework in the application layer.

## Features

- Generates the project structure with the command `scaffold create:project`.
- Generates models in the domain layer with the command `scaffold create:entity`.
- Generates interfaces in the required component with the command `scaffold create:interface`.
- Generates interface resources with the command `scaffold create:interface-resource`.
- Generates services and their implementations in the domain layer with the command `scaffold create:service`.
- Generates service resources with the command `scaffold create:service-resource`.
- Generates ORM adapters in the infrastructure layer with the command `scaffold create:adapter-orm`.

### Get started

To use the Clean Architecture Scaffold, install the plugin globally on your computer:

```shell
    npm i -g @tsclean/scaffold
```

After that we generate the project structure with the command **`scaffold create:project`**, which receives one parameter **`--name`**.

```shell
    scaffold create:project --name=[project name]
```

```shell
    cd project name
```
